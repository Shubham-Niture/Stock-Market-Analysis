#Stock Market Analysis with Sentiment Insights
This project is all about analyzing stock market trends and understanding how sentiment can influence stock prices. We use Python and some amazing libraries to fetch stock data, process it, and even throw in some sentiment analysis for good measure!

What This Project Does:
Fetches Stock Data: Using the yfinance API, we pull historical data for Indian stocks (or any stock you choose!).

Time Series Analysis:
Decomposes stock prices into trend, seasonality, and residuals.
Smoothens data with moving averages and exponential smoothing.

Forecasting:
Predicts future stock prices using ARIMA and SARIMA models.

Sentiment Analysis:
Analyzes related keywords to assess overall market sentiment and its potential impact.

How to Use
Clone this repository.
Install the required Python libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib statsmodels yfinance textblob
Update the stock ticker symbol in the code (default is "RELIANCE.BO" for Reliance Industries on the Bombay Stock Exchange).
Run the script and enjoy the plots and insights!

Why It’s Cool
